# Machine Learning Concepts
In this repository I will be explaining various Machine Learning Concepts(Models/Algorithms) such Baysian Classifier using continuous data etc.
The __Code__ and __explaination__ of different Machine Learning Algorithms example will be a bit different from the regular stuff you would usually find on the Web (At least I couldn't find when I was doing these).

Some of the algorithms and datasets are a part of _Assignments_ by __Dr. Vasillis Athitsos__ class on Machine Learning at the University of Texas at Arlington.

Here is the list of the concepts and Codebase of the Machine learning algorithm.

2. [Linear Regression.](https://github.com/AkshayShenvi/MachineLearningConcepts/tree/master/Linear%20Regression)
